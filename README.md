# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTIONS
This project aims to predict the stock prices of Microsoft using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. The model is trained on historical stock data and can make predictions based on user-provided input such as date and volume.
Certainly! Below is a sample README file for your stock price prediction project:

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `MicrosoftStock.csv`: CSV file containing historical stock data for Microsoft.
- `stock.py`: Python script implementing the stock price prediction model and the Streamlit web app.
- `microsoft_stock_model.h5`: Pre-trained LSTM model for stock price prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```

2. Ensure that `MicrosoftStock.csv` is present in the project directory.

3. Run the Streamlit web app:

```
streamlit run stock.py
```

4. Interact with the web app by selecting a date and entering the volume. The app will then predict the stock price based on the provided input.
